OncoLens - Breast Cancer Predictor

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using histological measurements. This project showcases real-world ML development from exploratory analysis through model optimization and explainability, built using Python, scikit-learn, and SHAP.

## Objective
The goal of this dataset is to explore, train, evaluate and optimize a breast cancer predictor algorithm based on the following models:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

Each model will be trained, evaluated, and compared based on its ability to classify malignant vs. benign tumors using Scikit-Learn's Breast Cancer dataset. The best performing initial model will be chosen for optimization by means of feature engineering and regularization. The model will then be exported and deployed through a basic UI app.

## Model Performance
Logistic Regression (Post-Optimization)
- Validation Accuracy: 94%
- Test Accuracy: 96%
Features Used: 5 (selected via Variance Threshold + RFE)

---

## Explainability
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret model predictions and understand feature impact on classification outcomes

---

## Deployment
The trained model is serialized using joblib and can be deployed via:
- Streamlit for interactive browser-based use
- Flask API with containerization (Docker) for integration into healthcare systems
Cloud platforms(e.g., AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Run) for production
